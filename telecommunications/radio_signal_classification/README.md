## Radio Signal Classification

In this project, an input spectrogram of a radio signal is fed to EfficientNet (a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture) particularly EfficientNet-B0 which is the baseline model to perform radio signal classification. The input spectrogram is formed by applying Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) to the segmented IQ sequences. Window functions such as Kaisar-Bessel window, Hamming window or Rectangular window can be used to perform STFT. The spectrogram represented as a 3D tensor along with a ground truth label is used to train and validate the model prior to using it for inference or prediction on real-world dataset. As an example, radio signals such as narrow band radio signals (consisting of two variants), a squiggle radio signal and a noisy signal are used to train and validate the classification model in this project.

A squiggle radio signal could be AM or FM signal whose complex envelope looks like a squiggle OR an interference/noise contributing to an undefined squiggle radio signal.
